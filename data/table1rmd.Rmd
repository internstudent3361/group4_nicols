This is a full breakdown of our group's process in creating Table 1. Suitable for rubber ducks.

First, as always, we needed to load in our libraries. We used tidyverse for general coding, dplyr for data wrangling and gt to create and visualise our table!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(gt)
```

Next, we loaded in our data using the read.csv function, and labelled it 'data1'. The csv file is located within a folder called data, hence the 'data/'.

```{r}
data1 <- read.csv("data/Nichols_et_al_data.csv")
```

Next, we went about cleaning the original data for easier use. 
With the function 'filter(include == 0)' we included in our data set only those that were eligible and filtered OUT those participants who were excluded from the analysis because they reported suspicion about the goals of the experiment and/or had participated in previous studies using the dots game.
Then, with the 'rename' function we renamed the variables in the table to have them make more sense in relation to what they actually measured and to line them up better with codebook in the OSF.
With the select function we culled the variables in the original data that we had no use for.

```{r}
data1 <- data1 %>% 
  filter(include == 0) %>% 
  rename(cond = con,
         claimpercent = claim,
         claimmoney = moneyclaim,
         CT_practice = completion.time..practice.included.,
         CT_payments = completion.time..payments.only.,
         religiosity = relig,
         religion = Religion) %>% 
  select(-CT_practice, -CT_payments, -CT, -CT_cheat, -Religion.Text, -affil_cong)
```

So, now that the data was tidied, we needed to create new variables as seen in table 1: negativity, positivty, tempo and impact (% claimed and sacredness variables already existed in the raw data set). We consulted the codebook on OSF to find out what exactly these variables were, what they measured and how they were calculated. They all turned out to be averages of variables already existing in the data, serving as a summary of a group of variables.
## question here: WHY is slow -7 and not -6? it's measured on a five point scale?

```{r}
data1 <- data1 %>% 
  mutate(
    negativity = (distressing + irritating + boring + sad)/4,
    positivity = (interesting + pleasant + exciting + relaxing + happy)/5,
    impact = (deep + powerful)/2,
    tempo = (fast + abs(slow-7))/2
  ) 
```

So, now that we had the new variables, we needed to find the descriptive statistics for them (ie the values in the table): means, standard deviations, confidence intervals and Cohen's d's. 

We started by using the group_by and summarise function but quickly realised this was not going to work because while this allowed us to visualise the descriptives, it did not create new values that we could use to input into a table.

```{r}
data1 %>% 
  group_by(cond) %>%
  summarise(mean_claim = mean(claimpercent, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_sac = mean(sacred, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_neg = mean(negativity, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_pos = mean(positivity, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_imp = mean(impact, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_temp = mean(tempo, na.rm = TRUE),
            SD_claim = sd(claimpercent, na.rm = TRUE),
            SD_sac = sd(sacred, na.rm = TRUE),
            SD_neg = sd(negativity, na.rm = TRUE),
            SD_pos = sd(positivity, na.rm = TRUE),
            SD_imp = sd(impact, na.rm = TRUE),
            SD_temp = sd(tempo, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

So, we consulted the codebook again, which did prove to be helpful despite being confusingly laid-out and despite containing some outdated code. Nevertheless, we came up with the following long piece of code to obtain values for the descriptives (Means, SDs and CIs) of each of the six variables (% claimed, sacredness, negatviity, positivity, tempo, impact) in the table, for each of the four conditions. So the code below is partitioned into six parts for the six variables in the table. For each variable, the code is partitioned into the four conditions (though control group only actually appears in the percent claimed variable because it doesnt apply to the other variables (that is, you can't rate the tempo or impact of no sound)). Then, within each condition there is six lines of code that compute six new values (mean, SD, number of responses, SE, upper and lower CI limit). 

Before we dive into how each descriptive value was calculated, we first want to explain how each value was LABELLED. Each new value was labelled as such: descriptive.conditionnumber.variable, where the control group is (1), white noise group is (2), secular music group is (3), and religious music group is (4). So, lets take 'sd3s' as an example. This is the standard deviation (sd) of the sacredness variable (s) in the secular music group (3). Or, for example, 'mean2i' is the mean of the impact variable (i) for the white noise group (2).

So, how did we compute each descriptive?

```{r}
# Percent claimed variable

Computing Cohen's d variable to measure effect size for each of the six variables across conditions:

The formula for Cohen's d is as follows...
![](Formula-for-Cohens-d.png)

As such, the lines of code below calculate the effect size (Cohen's d) for each variable in the religious music condition in comparison with each variable in the other conditions. The abs() function was added to visualise all the effect sizes as absolute values, as done in the original table. Similarly to the other variables, the labels for the Cohen d effect sizes are labelled in the following manner: d standing for Cohen's d, the number referring to which effect comparison between conditions this variable is measuring (1 = relig vs sec, 2 
= reglig vs noise, 3 = relig vs control), then the final letter represents which of the six variables is being measured (eg n for negativity).
